USV files needs to be able to be updated when needed, as it stores lots of data.
But on P2P you can't handle updates of a compressed file.
Because of it, .USV files will be used just for transfers/downloads. But inside ZN, .USV files will be decompressed and distributed/managed as folders and individual files by data/content.json. git archive will also be used.
