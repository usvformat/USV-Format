USV files needs to be able to be updated when needed, as it stores lots of data.
But on P2P you can't handle updates of a compressed file.
Because of it, .USV files will be used just for transfers/downloads. But inside ZN, .USV files will be decompressed and distributed/managed as folders and individual files by data/content.json. git archive will also be used.

USV 1.0:
Supports loop videos (USVL)
license
credits
video player in HTML
And basically, can set the video speed and till which frame it is played, and metadata of videos

USV 1.1:
boolean if its paid
boolean if its fictional (or hybrid)
thumbnail
indicative rating

USV 2.0:
More than one tag to declare which speed of playing and till which frame (speed can change according to in which frames it is playing), audio.xml and audio folder, can play more than one audio from the same begin and set in which frames each audio stops

USV 2.1:
blockscreens, like/dislike button, watch later button on card videos, subscribe button, cards, annotations, links of videos/playlists/channels, endscreens, framebg settings, video original language

USV 3.0:
.JSON
multilanguage for audio folder, video metadata, and XML
CSS animations, programmation, inter-frame compression, AV1
Blockscreen with GIF and items (if like and subs, show also dslk and unsbs)
can also use other gifs and audios





Second part of the first USV loop: 2,24 MB (USV) - 667 KB (original)

First part (Super Canarinho)

USV JPG: 730 KB
Original: 359 KB
USV opt-PNG bg-clipping: 1,19 MB
GIF strip/sprite: 1,58 MB

Workaround to achieve 359 KB and lower:
Convert JPG to background-clipping image and apply chromakey color over transparent, and convert it to BMP/WEBP

XML format for video infos
